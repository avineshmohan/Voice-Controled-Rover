# Voice-Controled-Rover
A rover that runs on wheels using Arduino controlled remotely through our voice command alone! (With the use of BitVoicer.)
Hello friends,

By this project, we have managed to control a rover or car using our voice command alone using BitVoicer (a third party propriety software).
Contents:

    Setup the Rover.

    Install and configure software required.

    Compile and execute the code.

Set Up the Rover:

Take a base for setting up wheels for motion add two wheels that compiles up to our Reer wheels. Add a ball bearing in the front and now u get an Auto-rickshaw like structure. Place Arduino and battery on to the board and afix them with screws. Now two DC motors on two wheels and connect them to a H-bridge motor driver. Connect the motor drive to the Arduino using jumper wires.

Install and Configure Software Required:

On your lapto, install Arduino software and open it. Connect the Arduino to the USB slot of laptop. In the tools section, select the Arduino Uno board and the COM port that you have plugged your Arduino into. Now install BitVoicer software from web.
Compile and Execute the Code:

Download the code from the link below and according to the code set commands on BitVoicer, connect an external microphone or earphone for voice commands. After setting up commmands, connect the Arduino to the laptop and upload the code.
